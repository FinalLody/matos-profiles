matos-profiles
==============

Matos is a mobile application analyzer. This repository contains stubs for MIDP (MSA profile) and Android (ICS) and tools to build them.
It also contains a way to build back a database of available methods in the different versions of Android.

To recompile the database, you must install Google Android SDK and define the property matos.android.sdk in matos-android-database/pom.xml.
